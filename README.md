# Speedbump Detector

This is a neural network envisioned to detect speedbumps signs, ~~with the potential to run it into a mobile environment later on~~ running on mobile devices. ðŸ¥³


## Dataset 

### Image backgrounds

The dataset is built merging templates and COCO (Common Objects in Context) images on these topics:

- 200 images on `dog`
- 200 images on `cat`
- 200 images on `person`
- 200 images on `bird`
- 200 images on `banana`
- 200 images on `sandwich`
- 200 images on `carrot`
- 200 images on `orange`
- 200 images on `apple`
- 200 images on `pizza`
- 200 images on `hot dog`
- 200 images on `donut`
- 200 images on `cake`
- 200 images on `chair`
- 200 images on `dining table`
- 200 images on `toilet`
- 200 images on `bed`
- 200 images on `couch`

### Templates

The template images where acquired via public access, and have the following properties:

- Dimensions: 70x70 pixels
- Color: yellow/orange
- Shape: rectangle/diamond

A total of 14 templates where used for this dataset creation

### Generating overlapped images for training
